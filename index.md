## ⚠️ Ethics in Data Visualization

Teaching data visualization isn't just about the technical skills. We must also teach students to:

- Identify deceptive practices (truncated axes, misleading scales)  
- Create honest representations of data  
- Question the stories that visualizations tell  
- Consider the consequences of their design choices  

> _"Ethical thinking is about not only intentions, but consequences." – Alberto Cairo_
