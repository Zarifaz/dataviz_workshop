# ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics in Data Visualization

‚Äú**Ethical thinking is about not only intentions, but consequences.**‚Äù  
‚Äî *Alberto Cairo*

This page explores how data visualizations can be misleading‚Äîintentionally or unintentionally‚Äîand outlines techniques and examples based on our workshop materials.

## üö© What Makes a Visualization Deceptive?

> *‚ÄúA graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message... which varies from the actual meaning.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî From *How Deceptive are Deceptive Visualizations?*

Types of issues include:
- Misleading visualizations
- Misinterpreted visualizations
- Ignoring design conventions
- Poor data communication practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques That Can Mislead

### 1. Truncated Y-Axis

![Truncated Axis](truncated_axis.png)

Truncating the Y-axis exaggerates small differences and can lead viewers to interpret the data as more dramatic than it is.

---

### 2. Dual Axis / Line Graphs

![Dual Axis Graph 1](dual_axis_line_graph_1.png)

![Dual Axis Graph 2](dual_axis_line_graph_2.jpg)

Using two y-axes can falsely imply correlation between unrelated variables if not clearly labeled or explained.

---

### 3. Cumulative Graphs vs Annual Trends

These two graphs show the same data in different ways:

#### Cumulative Revenue

![Cumulative Revenue](annual_revenue_cumulative.png)

This can falsely suggest consistent growth, even when annual revenues are declining.

#### Annual Revenue

![Annual Revenue](annual_revenue.png)

Annual view reveals a steady decline after 2005.

### 4. Ignoring Conventions

Reversing axes or inverting visuals without clear reason can distort interpretation.

#### Example:

Original graph:

![Gun Deaths - Conventions ignored](gun_death_left.png)

How it should look:

![Gun Deaths - Following regular convention](gun_death_right.png)

The first chart is flipped vertically, misleading viewers about whether the trend is increasing or decreasing.

## üß† Example of Misleading Framing

![Planned Parenthood Chart](dual_axis_line_graph_1.png)

This chart uses angled labels and dramatic colors to visually emphasize a controversial message, but fails to provide full data context.

---

## üìä Spurious Correlations

![Spider Correlation](dual_axis_line_graph_2.jpg)

Just because two lines look similar doesn‚Äôt mean there's a meaningful relationship. This chart shows a perfect example of **correlation without causation**.

## ‚úÖ Tips for Ethical Visualization (Alberto Cairo)

From [Storybench Interview](https://www.storybench.org/six-ways-alberto-cairo-thinks-you-can-improve-your-data-visualizations/):

1. Don‚Äôt just look at charts‚Äî**read them**
2. Always **cite your data source**
3. Be cautious not to **over-interpret**
4. Use appropriate **scales and ranges**
5. Acknowledge **uncertainty**
6. Update ethical standards as tools and times change

## üìù Five-Minute Critique

Practice looking at charts and asking:
- What story is being told?
- Is anything left out?
- Are any design choices exaggerating or hiding patterns?
